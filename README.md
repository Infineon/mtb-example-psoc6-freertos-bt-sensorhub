## Supported toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm&reg; Embedded Compiler v10.3.1 (`GCC_ARM`) - Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`
- Arm&reg; Compiler v6.16 (`ARM`)
- IAR C/C++ Compiler v9.30.1 (`IAR`)

## Supported kits (make variable 'TARGET')

- [PSoC&trade; 6 Bluetooth&reg; LE pioneer kit](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-062-BLE) (`CY8CKIT-062-BLE`)

## Hardware setup
This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** The PSoC&trade; 6 Bluetooth&reg; LE Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) ship with EINK Display and KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software setup

Download and install the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect app on your [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.infineon.airocbluetoothconnect) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/airoc-bluetooth-connect-app/id6443702288) phone.

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en). All other required software come bundled with the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software.


## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the Quick Panel.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example clones the "[Bluetooth&reg; LE SensorHub](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc6-freertos-bt-sensorhub)" application with the desired name "MySensorHub" configured for the *CY8CKIT-062-BLE* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-062-BLE--app-id mtb-example-btstack-freertos-capsense-buttons-slider --user-app-name MyCapsenseButtonsSlider --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

<br>

The following example adds the CY8CKIT-062-BLE BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app:

   ```
   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MySensorHub" --add-bsp-name APP_CY8CKIT-062-BLE --add-bsp-version "latest-v4.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MySensorHub" --set-active-bsp APP_CY8CKIT-062-BLE
   ```

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
    </details>
    <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
    </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. observe the messages on the UART terminal, and wait for the device to make all the required connections. Use the KitProg3 COM port to view the Bluetooth stack and application trace messages in the terminal window as shown in Figure 1.

### Test using AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect mobile app

1. Turn ON Bluetooth&reg; on your Android or iOS device.

2. Launch the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect app.

3. Press the reset switch on the CY8CKIT-062-BLE kit to start sending advertisements. The red LED (LED1) starts blinking. Advertising will stop after 90 seconds if a connection has not been established.

4. Swipe down on the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect app home screen to start scanning for Bluetooth&reg; LE Peripherals; your device (“Sensor Hub”) appears in the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect app home screen. Select your device to establish a Bluetooth&reg; LE connection.

    One service is shown in the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect carousel view.

5. Select the **Unknown Service** and then select the characteristic with the *Notify* property.

6. Select **Notify**. The device will start sending GATT notifications to the mobile.

7. Click the user button (SW2) to change the notification interval. Figure 2 shows the terminal logs for different notification intervals.

   **Figure 2. Terminal log for Notification intervals**

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.


## Design and implementation

This code example implements a Bluetooth&reg; GATT Server and GAP Peripheral role, ADC, and I2C on the PSoC&trade; 6 MCU. Once the device is powered ON, it boots up and does the following:

1. Initializes the Bluetooth&reg; stack

2. Initializes UART

3. Initializes I2C and ADC

4. Registers a button interrupt

5. Initializes the notification timer for all sensors

6. Registers the GATT database and GATT events callback

7. Initializes all sensors

8. Starts undirected advertisements

You can now connect to the device using a GAP Central device. Upon connection, the device will request connection parameters to be updated (specifically, the connection interval to 100 ms). If the request is accepted, the connection interval changes to 100 ms.

The GAP Central device can now discover all attributes and enable GATT notifications. The Peripheral will start sending sensor values with the defined interval. Moving the board changes the values in the console output.

The GATT Server implements a custom service with a custom characteristic. This characteristic is readable and notifiable.

### Resources and settings

- **Device Configurator:** ModusToolbox&trade; stores the device configuration settings of the application in the *design.modus* file. This file is used by the Device Configurator, which generate the configuration firmware. This file is stored in the respective kit BSP folder in *mtb_shared* project. For example, for CY8CKIT-062-BLE the path is *<workspace_path>mtb_shared\TARGET_CY8CKIT-062-BLE\latest-v3.X\COMPONENT_BSP_DESIGN_MODUS/design.modus*.

   See the [Device Configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-ModusToolbox_Device_Configurator_Guide_4-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d718a49017d99ab297631cb&utm_source=cypress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=202110_globe_en_all_integration-files).

- **Bluetooth&reg; Configurator:** The Bluetooth&reg; Peripheral has an additional configurator called the “Bluetooth&reg; Configurator” that is used to generate the Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT database and various Bluetooth&reg; settings for the application. These settings are stored in the file named *design.cybt*. Note that unlike the Device Configurator, the Bluetooth&reg; Configurator settings and files are local to each respective application. As explained in the [Design and implementation](#design-and-implementation) section, the only extra service added is the Immediate Alert Service (IAS).

    See the [Bluetooth&reg; Configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-ModusToolbox_Bluetooth_Configurator_Guide_3-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d718a49017d99aaf5b231be&utm_source=cypress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=202110_globe_en_all_integration-files).
